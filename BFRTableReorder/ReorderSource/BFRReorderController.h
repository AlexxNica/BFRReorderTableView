/**
 This class houses the logic for reordering @c ASCellNode instances. It's meant to be used as a category for any @c ASTableNode instance. It works by shuffling around data source items via it's delegate property, @cBFRTableViewReorderDelegate, and by creating a snapshot node that is dragged up and down that mimics the look of the node that was long pressed on. The snapshot node is configurable via the public properties found in this class. Note that you should invoke @c -(BOOL)shouldShowSpacerNodeForIndexPath:indexPath within @c -(ASCellNodeBlock)tableNode:tableNodenodeBlockForRowAtIndexPath: to see whether or not you should supply a spacer node at the given @c NSIndexPath.
